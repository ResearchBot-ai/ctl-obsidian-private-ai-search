    decision_maker: "agent.lifecycle.signal"
    decision_type: "ingestion"
    rationale: |
      User research documents (user-interview-notes.md and user-profile.md) provided
      sufficient detail and specificity for signal normalization. Direct primary research
      with advanced knowledge worker demonstrated clear pain points, feature requirements,
      and privacy concerns related to RAG-enabled Obsidian plugin.

          score: 1.0
          confidence_impact: 0.20

          score: 0.5
          confidence_impact: 0.05
          rationale: "Comprehensive detail but single user source (N=1), requires market validation"
          gaps:
            - "Market size validation"
            - "Additional user interviews"
            - "Competitive analysis depth"

          rating: "low"
          score: 1.0
          confidence_impact: 0.15
          rationale: "Highly specific and actionable findings, clear prioritization, minimal contradictions"
        consistency:
          rating: "high"
          score: 1.0
          confidence_impact: 0.15
          rationale: "Coherent narrative, aligns with Obsidian domain knowledge, privacy concerns consistent throughout"
    rationale: |
      Signal demonstrates high source trust (direct primary research), low noise (specific
      actionable findings), and strong consistency (coherent narrative aligned with domain
      knowledge). Medium completeness due to N=1 sample size is acceptable given exceptional
      depth and specificity of research. All quality dimensions meet or exceed standards.
      Quality score of 0.875 significantly exceeds 0.70 threshold for promotion.

        segment_confirmation: "CONFIRMED - User profile validated across sources"
        competitive_confirmation: "CONFIRMED - Significant gaps identified"
    rationale: |
      All five validation success criteria met or exceeded with overwhelming evidence.

      CORROBORATION: Signal corroborated by 3 independent validation sources (GitHub,
      Reddit/Forums, Forum scraped data) across diverse platforms and time periods.

      MARKET DEMAND: Confirmed as VERY HIGH through:
      - 200K+ plugin installs (Smart Connections alone)
      - 18+ competing plugin implementations (strong market pull)
      - 22+ community discussions spanning 5 years (sustained interest)
      - 15+ unique users expressing explicit need in forum data

      TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY: Confirmed through multiple working plugin implementations
      using proven RAG technology. Local processing validated via Ollama, LM Studio,
      llama.cpp integrations. Performance challenges known and addressable.

      USER SEGMENT: Confirmed across all sources as advanced knowledge workers with:
      - Large vaults (1000+ notes causing search pain)
      - Privacy focus (work compliance or data sovereignty concerns)
      - Technical sophistication (capable of local LLM setup)
      - Active in Obsidian power-user community

      PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS: STRONGLY VALIDATED as critical (not nice-to-have):
      - 30% of forum discussions emphasize privacy/local processing
      - Multiple users explicitly reject cloud AI solutions
      - Privacy is core Obsidian community value (local-first philosophy)
      - Users actively verify privacy claims (network disconnect tests)

      COMPETITIVE GAPS: Significant opportunities identified despite 18+ existing plugins:
      - Privacy-first-by-default positioning (unique in market)
      - Integrated UX (current solutions require multiple plugins)
      - Performance optimization for scale (current solutions struggle >1000 notes)
      - Cross-platform consistency (mobile parity opportunity)

      Signal achieves maximum confidence (1.00) and is recommended for promotion to
      TRUSTED state. Evidence is overwhelming and consistent across all validation
      dimensions. Market need is real, urgent (for target segment), and growing.
