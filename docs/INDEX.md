## Documentation Lifecycle

Documentation flows through the following lifecycle:

1. **Research** → Initial research and discovery (01-research/)
2. **Planning** → Personas, vision, UX journeys (02-04/)
3. **Definition** → Requirements, epics, features (05-07/)
4. **Decomposition** → User stories, tasks, micro-tasks, nano-tasks (08-11/)
5. **Mapping** → Story mapping (12/)
6. **Release** → Roadmap, plans, work queue (13-15/)

## Adding Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Determine the appropriate directory based on the artifact type
2. Follow naming conventions (lowercase-with-hyphens.md)
3. Include proper YAML frontmatter
4. Update the directory's INDEX.md with a link to the new document
5. Reference related documents for traceability

## Standards Compliance

All documentation must comply with:
- [Enterprise Documentation Standard](../../../../../../enterprise/chl-standards/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md)
- [Enterprise Directory Standard](../../../../../../enterprise/chl-standards/standards/DIRECTORY_STANDARD.md)
- Context-specific standards (when applicable)
